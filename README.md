# 🚀 Secure n8n Deployment with Docker Compose

A complete and secure `n8n` automation stack using Docker Compose. This setup includes:

- ✅ PostgreSQL for workflow and credential storage
- ✅ Qdrant for vector DB / AI use cases
- ✅ NGINX reverse proxy with local HTTPS via Let's Encrypt
- ✅ Cloudflare Tunnel for secure public access (no port forwarding needed)

Everything starts with a single command:  
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

## 📦 Stack Components

| Service       | Description                                                                 |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `n8n`         | Workflow automation platform                                                |
| `PostgreSQL`  | Backend DB for persistent workflow storage                                  |
| `Qdrant`      | Vector DB for advanced AI/search integrations                               |
| `NGINX`       | Local reverse proxy with automatic SSL using Let's Encrypt                 |
| `Cloudflared` | Secure tunnel to expose `n8n` publicly (no need to open ports!)             |

## 🌍 Local vs Public Access

You can choose how you want to access your n8n:

| Use Case                     | NGINX | Cloudflare Tunnel |
|-----------------------------|:-----:|:------------------:|
| Home lab only               | ✅    | ❌                 |
| Remote access securely      | ✅    | ✅                 |
| Avoid router configuration  | ❌    | ✅                 |
| Maximum flexibility         | ✅    | ✅                 |

> 💡 If you **only want local access**, you can disable/remove the `cloudflared` service.  
> 💡 If you **only want remote access**, you can remove the `nginx` and `acme-companion` services.
